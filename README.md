# A sample application using Kafka, Node.js and Docker

## 1. About Kafka Streaming

Below is the discription from the official Kafka web site.

Apache KafkaÂ® is a distributed streaming platform.

It publishes and subscribes to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging syste

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

To learn more about Kafka, please visit [Kafka official web site](https://kafka.apache.org/)

Kafka is build in Java, it does provide APIs from many other lanhuages.

Since I am a Javascript developer, I decided to use Node.js for this sample application.

There are a few libraries for Node.js, some popular libraries include:

* [node-rdkafka](https://github.com/Blizzard/node-rdkafka)

* [Kafka-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kafka-node)

* [KafkaJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kafkajs) 

I use KafkaJs in this example. The main reason is it has better documentation then the other two.



## 2. Use case - track travellers who may infected by Coronarirus virus

We are going to build an applicaiton, to track petential travellers who may have been infected by Coronavirus.

1. We check travellers temperature at major airports.
2. Temperature and traveller's personal infomration are sent to the Kafka queue (as producer). Note every airport is a prodcuer.
3. We have another app check every message sent to the queue (near real time), and alert is triggered if we a passenger has higher temperature and has overseas travel history.



## 3. Build local Kafka environemnt using Docker and Container

In order to run the application locally, we need at least two docker imagers

* zookeeper
* Kafka Broker

In the real envirnment, you will need multiple Kafka brokers, to form a cluster.

In stead of build my own docker imagers, I cloned the code from https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker, which give me everything I need to run Kafka on my local container





```yml
version: "2"
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
  kafka:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: localhost
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "flight:1:1"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

```
